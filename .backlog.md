## proper intro

Having a presentation view.
The app should say something this is my life, this are my roles.
these roles have goals,
i work on it through habits, etc.

The info sections should be in a very detailed example
or better we should write a blog about the tool,
since markdown is easier to format.

Have option to load various examples;
student, work, lockdown, very-simple-basic-which-is-template, digital-nomad etc.

## mutliple views

- View for showing off; this is my life, my roles, my goals and my routines
- edit view
- personal dashboard (includes TMM), not sure if this is needed

Present people the option for examples if no URL provided.
Sharing only via public link, so we'll remove the current logic with facebook login
which in unclear!

## calendar V5

https://fullcalendar.io/blog/2020/02/changes-in-the-upcoming-v5

And warp it in a js module.

## interlinking
We could link activities to intelligences,
see deprecated/model.js

+ http://mlvl.github.io/Hierarchie/#/

## Example templates

Directory structure + separation for routines, leave the other files the same.
- `example-data/routines/[student,work,lockdown].yml`
