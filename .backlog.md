## create calendar first

Validate that the generation of graphs still works if the source data comes from a calendar.

We designed the format of the Ical body so that it can be parsed easily.
However, we do not have a ical first way of parsing calendar data to routines.
The data formats are already geared towards this way of working,
thus we can implement it when the priority is set to it.

## effectiveness_of_time_spent

## proper intro

Having a presentation view.
The app should say something this is my life, this are my roles.
these roles have goals,
i work on it through habits, etc.

The info sections should be in a very detailed example
or better we should write a blog about the tool,
since markdown is easier to format.

Have option to load various examples;
student, work, lockdown, very-simple-basic-which-is-template, digital-nomad etc.

## ideas for calendar view

be a low bar /high bar or default minute or something else,
but it is easy if the name can have the time in it.

then if you have like;
```
05 a
02 b
02 c

min_planned activity_name; effectiveness_of_time_spent start_deviation time_spent

05 test;.8 -2 6 some optional comment

at the end
```
and there is 10min allocated for the event, there is 1min or 10% slacktime.


## interlinking
We could link activities to intelligences,
see deprecated/model.js

+ http://mlvl.github.io/Hierarchie/#/

## solar noon time in calendar view

Show the sunrise/dawn and sundown time, together with solar noon in calendar overview,
visualizing what is done during daylight and what is not.
