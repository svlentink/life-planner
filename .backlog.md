## proper intro

Having a presentation view.
The app should say something this is my life, this are my roles.
these roles have goals,
i work on it through habits, etc.

The info sections should be in a very detailed example
or better we should write a blog about the tool,
since markdown is easier to format.

Have option to load various examples;
student, work, lockdown, very-simple-basic-which-is-template, digital-nomad etc.

## ideas for calendar view

change names to `walking_20`, where 20 states the amount of minutes,
there can still be a low bar /high bar or default minute or something else,
but it is easy if the name can have the time in it.

then if you have like;
```
05 a
02 b
02 c

min_planned activity_name; effectiveness_of_time_spent start_deviation time_spent

05 test;.8 -2 6 some optional comment

at the end
```
and there is 10min allocated for the event, there is 1min or 10% slacktime.

## visualize energy
when there are tasks that provide energy and when there are draining items on the agenda

## mutliple views

- View for showing off; this is my life, my roles, my goals and my routines
- edit view
- personal dashboard (includes TMM), not sure if this is needed

Present people the option for examples if no URL provided.
Sharing only via public link, so we'll remove the current logic with facebook login
which in unclear!

## calendar V5

https://fullcalendar.io/blog/2020/02/changes-in-the-upcoming-v5

And warp it in a js module.

## interlinking
We could link activities to intelligences,
see deprecated/model.js

+ http://mlvl.github.io/Hierarchie/#/

## Example templates

Directory structure + separation for routines, leave the other files the same.
- `example-data/routines/[student,work,lockdown].yml`

## solar noon time in calendar view

Show the sunrise/dawn and sundown time, together with solar noon in calendar overview,
visualizing what is done during daylight and what is not.
