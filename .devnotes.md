- actual spend time (when finsihed)
- create_by (multi user)
- create_on (intresting metric)
- status (stages of scrum backlog)
- responsible (user)
- moscow rating
- Due dates
- categories
- priority
- boolean:passion, denoted by heart, option for other symbols like iron for gym

.

- small actionable projects
- tasks/items; an overview per category (having dedicated time blocks for each)
- one system for all tasks, not email, notes(keep), etc.
- use fixed time blocks, plan items in that time block, you are never done, therefore allocate time per subject
- allow import of multiple yaml files
- PREP / TO DO / DOING / ON HOLD / DONE / CANCELLED


maybe use scrum per area of life?

Which questions are uncomfortable or confronting?
These questions should be asked, they address an unconfronted/unresolved issue.

### Religions

When we study religions,
we see practices like mindfulness, self-reflection etc.
incorporated into their rituals and practices.
Being a good religious person could provide mental stability
through the use of the same practices but used in a different form
such as prayer, gratitude and repentence.

We haven't looked at the correlation between secular psychology
and the practices found in religions.

### How we love, Podcast on NPR

"A lot of people;
they either go into a relationship not really knowing what they want
and they change
or they have settled.
And when you make your list,
when you really think about who it is who is that is going to make you happy in the long term
and what you're going to need,
that should be the time you
make the most detailed list of your entire life.
I know people who have a hand full of things they are looking for in a mate,
but who have groceries list that are 3 pages long.
You are grocery shopping for a soul mate."

In the eyes of a forgiving almighty God, a human is like that baby.

Why does a bully hurt age-mates and not kids half his age?
Since the little ones are not a challenge/threat to him.
The same goes for adults, if you're bullied, you are seen as a threat/challenge.
This does not apply to psychopaths.

Cognitive Dissonance about yourself, we paint the picture of being an athelete so the cognitive dissonance will help you motivate to change it to not have that dissonance anymore.

do 10 per hour,
if you weren't able to do it every hour,
make it every even hour.
while doing replanning, have self compassion,

objectives -> quests/subtasks/sidequests
analysis paralysis
difficulty -> 
clear goals; clearly define goal, steps, rewards, a roadmap like in a game to the end
write it down, roadmap to end follow substaps, small steps, breakdown in small chunks, reduce difficulty
set a low bar
not everything can be broken down in small chunks, gamify resistance, that euphoria of jumping of the edge into the water, absorbe the resistance and absorb its power, the greater the resistance, the greater the power, they are powerups. You become better at discomformt or risk.

Meta-Learning: Learning how to learn
1. Get Early Wins - Wins = Dopamine = Motivation = Practicing = Wins
2. Pick the right teacher - Not the best at what they do, but the best at teaching it.
3. Key Leverage Points - 80/20 rule. What can you do for the least time that will give you the most results in your learning?
4. Tighten Feedback Loop - Get feedback quickly and more often. Because feedback leads to improvement.
5. Have courage to get worse - We must do the things we are bad at, to strengthen them
6. Shift your identity (most important) - Improve your self-image, see yourself as capable of learning things.

somethings should stay hobby;
e.g. making music is good for making friends in a band, relaxation,
winding down, or spiritual experiences, but not for work,
but it supports work.

For conscientiousness, the sub-components are: Orderliness — the preference for routines, deliberation, and detail-orientation. Industriousness — the tendency to stay focused and to pursue goals in a determined way.

2. Cram early: Cram the right way. Focus on the structure initially. Focus on the fine details later.
a. Structure Focused: create anchor points of relevance. build prior knowledge.
b. Detail Focused: 
"There is a time for learning everything."
3. Build Prior Knowledge: Get general knowledge. Increase in complexity every iteration.

- still the right focus? working on right projects?

Energy effort curve. When starting, everything requires so much more cognitive attention and thus energy,
hang in there, it will become habitual, it will become easier.

# Starting multiple things?

Normally, when changing habits, or starting a new project,
it's like trying to do a take-off and ascend of a plane.
It requires so much more energy in the initial phase than
when cruzing at high altitude.
The same goes for structuring your life with multiple aspects in your new routine.
Do adhere to the allocated time,
but do give yourself some slack in case you don't get all out of it what you aspired to.

See it as an [organized day trip](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pros-cons-organized-tour-you-turpal/),
you are going to be at all spots organized,
but your level of involvement/participation is up to you.
We're just focusing on getting the rythm/habits into your life.


an externalizer doesn't have an internal locus of control, regulating emotions by controlling everyting around them instead of self


as a developer I might be able to create systems
that are more efficient for me than any system out there.
however, you probably won't optimize for user friendliness
if you are the only one using the system.
So ask yourself, do you wish to live up to an old age?
If yes, than make sure you already use systems that are easy
for others to take over in case you get old/jailed or want to outsource that task to increase productivity.

don't have the illusion you can setup your life in an orderly way,
would the kings of the 1800 who had full dictatorship have such illusion?
don't try to get a handle on your life, but put your effort in doing stuff
don't have the narcissism to think you can control your life
It's a framework/foundation, but you should move on top of it with agility

would you stay a friend to yourself?
are you reliable, do you do what you said you would do?
Do you have self-respect

Hemingway Bridge,
stop a task/leave a party before you feel tired or the highlight,
so you feel more engage to go again


you dont need more motivation, you need more clarity, you dont need more time you need more focus

when doing behavior you don't want to do (e.g. tiktok/smoke/etc.)
ask yourself, do I want this behavioral pattern to be solidified more into my brain?

we all have a moral imperative to do the best we can all the time, otherwise we treat ourselves as a mean to an end (Kant)
we all have a moral imperative to do the best we can all the time, otherwise we treat ourselves as a mean to an end (Kant) since you are not maximizing the potential of your consciousness but you're using your consciousness as a means to stimulate your emotional ends

Is my vice "fun" or escapism?
escapism is possible when lying to yourself, a failure to confront your own mind and reality, lying and cheating yourself out of life potential
escapism is cheating yourself out of life potential
lying to yourself is the same as lying to someone else

People Don't Fail, They Give Up
You're one liner to know what to do, to keep on going;
Who's going to carry the boats and the logs?
Would you be happy if your daughter dated a copy of you?
Would you want your daughter to date you?
What would Jesus do?
Who is going to carry the boats and the logs?
Light weight baby!
Be still, and know that I am God (Psalm 46:10)

The comparison with a good management team.
There are example of famous rappers who clearly have an IQ below average,
but they still manage to look good and get a solid income
because of their good management/marketing team behind them.
If below average people can get above average results with good external management,
can we as above average people get also increase our output
with a good management tool?

live for a reflective life
future you lives way longer with the decisions made,
than the present you can justify to choose short term gratification
immediate pleasure derived from an action is unirelevant,
optimize for long term happiness with the decisions made

normal psychology is fague.
you usually don't track progress and it's hard to compare with a friend how your treatment is going vs theirs.
This is a feature, serving the therapist/coach, making it harder to switch because you would have the startup phase again with them.
