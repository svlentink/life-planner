Dopamine source (passion); consumption (addiction) vs. creation (passion). List of hobbies, wikipedia

great hobbies are created through sweat and persistence,
your first music/sports class wasn't something that relaxed you

### raw notes

- estimated time, if too large, demand to split into tasks, not possible, do research first, plan time for that
- actual spend time (when finsihed)
- create_by (multi user)
- create_on (intresting metric)
- status (stages of scrum backlog)
- responsible (user)
- moscow rating
- Due dates
- categories
- priority
- boolean:passion, denoted by heart, option for other symbols like iron for gym

.

- small actionable projects
- tasks/items; an overview per category (having dedicated time blocks for each)
- one system for all tasks, not email, notes(keep), etc.
- use fixed time blocks, plan items in that time block, you are never done, therefore allocate time per subject
- allow import of multiple yaml files
- PREP / TO DO / DOING / ON HOLD / DONE / CANCELLED


maybe use scrum per area of life?

Which questions are uncomfortable or confronting?
These questions should be asked, they address an unconfronted/unresolved issue.
(ACT therapy)
Face your feers and confront your hidden issues.
Escape or come to terms with oneself.
Emotional reflection.

## Future work

### Religions

When we study religions,
we see practices like mindfulness, self-reflection etc.
incorporated into their rituals and practices.
Being a good religious person could provide mental stability
through the use of the same practices but used in a different form
such as prayer, gratitude and repentence.

We haven't looked at the correlation between secular psychology
and the practices found in religions.

### How we love, Podcast on NPR

"A lot of people;
they either go into a relationship not really knowing what they want
and they change
or they have settled.
And when you make your list,
when you really think about who it is who is that is going to make you happy in the long term
and what you're going to need,
that should be the time you
make the most detailed list of your entire life.
I know people who have a hand full of things they are looking for in a mate,
but who have groceries list that are 3 pages long.
You are grocery shopping for a soul mate."
**Amy Webb**

review agenda
per item

also not time differenence of how far planned ahead,
how quick rated the event afterwards

We do this per routine,
since per item of routine would be an administrative burden
and we want the routine as a whole to be optimal, not the subitems.

twice per week 10k, if failed 2weeks, don't compensate, but forgive oneself and do half of it (low bar)

motivation, ability, prompt, factors for habits/actions.




twice per week 10k
if failed 2weeks (weather, stress, health etc.), don't compensate with 15k, but instead do 5k, low bar, more likely to do again, hungry for more.

work out an example with biphasic sleep (during some night?); e.g. sleep from 3-7 and from 17:30 21:30, which gives you 8-5 to work with 1h break and 22:00 02:00 for social life.
and use the midday break for an excersize or groceries

What are some principles in your life that you try to always adhere to?
What are you most passionate about?
Tell me about a value you used to hold but have changed your mind on.
What values have you inherited from your family?
How important are formal value systems to you (e.g. religious commandments)?
What values do you think it’s important that we share and see basically eye-to-eye on?
What are your political values? Ethical values? Career values? Creative values?

Babies get unearned love from adults,
even if cries, you love.
The same goes for religious people.
In the eyes of a forgiving almighty God, a human is like that baby.

Why does a bully hurt age-mates and not kids half his age?
Since the little ones are not a challenge/threat to him.
The same goes for adults, if you're bullied, you are seen as a threat/challenge.
This does not apply to psychopaths.

two approaches of coorporates;
thinking in projects or products, you are your own product, not project.
Thus be a product owner/manager, not a project manager

the reason we use the calendar is because it serves as implementation intention
fail preportum, why would you fail, not follow trough; kill the company exercise, pre-plan for these risks/plan B, C 

The 5 Second Rule

Cognitive Dissonance about yourself, we paint the picture of being an athelete so the cognitive dissonance will help you motivate to change it to not have that dissonance anymore.


review your calendar,
if you weren't able to do 20pushups every hour,
do 10 per hour,
if you weren't able to do it every hour,
make it every even hour.
while doing replanning, have self compassion,
you would also say to a failed child,
good for trying, better next time, let's go for it.
commit to it.

be caustious to not burnout, you won't run a marathon every day,
thus do not peak every day! Get some rest.
