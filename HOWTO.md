# HOWTO life planner

This page explains how to use
[this life-planner](https://lent.ink/projects/life-planner/).

### Self psychology

We initially focussed on the end goal picture,
but we should not only look at what we want or strive to become,
but who we are.
Psychoanalysis on one self is as important,
enstablishing your baseline and come to terms with your current self.
Know your inner feelings, desires and weaknesses,
address and acknowledge them.

### YAML

The data for the life planner is stored in YAML,
a human readable data format which you can safe to a file
and works perfectly with version control software (Git).

If an error occurs, please first verify that your data is the correct format
by using an online YAML validator.

We recommend storing it on a public git repository,
which allows you to open it by appending `#YOUR-URL` to the life-planner.
Example:

```
https://lent.ink/projects/life-planner/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svlentink/life-planner/master/example.yml
```
Or you can paste it into the text area on the bottom of the life planner.


### Values

Start with addressing your general values in life.
Search for `values:` in the
[example](https://github.com/svlentink/life-planner/blob/master/example.yml).

### Roles

Define the roles you have as an individual.
Search for `personas:` in the example.

### Values per role

When we have addressed our generic values,
we also define the values per role we have.
What's important to you?

For example, when it comes to work (role = employee),
it could be:
- money
- being meaningful in the lives of others
- personal development
- solid pension
- travel a lot
- becoming better as a leader (not a boss)
- push for innovation
- progress in career


Search for `TODO THIS NOT NOT IMPLEMENTED YET` in the example.
