        For historical purposes, I've created an overview of my life of when I was a part time student
        and of my pre lockdown life (work with commuting).
        Nowadays my life switches between 3 modes; work from home (WFH) in NL (cold climate in winter),
        WFH in a warmer climate (thus doing sports outdoors)
        and being a digital nomad.
        All 5 lives are arranged differently.

            During the lockdown in 2020 I went flying as digital nomad.
            This became harder in 2021 and some major border crossing were closed,
            but small bike / pedestrian crossings remained open.
            This enabled me to use these roads to travel with my motorcycles through
            various countries in the EU (as a digital nomad).
