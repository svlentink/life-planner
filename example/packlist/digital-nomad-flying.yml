  - tips:
    - During packing, two laundry bins, one for what to wear/pack on me, one for the backpack.
    - always put some clothing in your hand luggage for when luggage get lost
    - everything that can leak, put it in a separate plastic bag
    - buy things duplicate, so you can have a set of stuff ready at all times (comb etc.)
    - Practice living out of your suitcase for a week before you leave; missed anything?
