  - tips:
    - everything that can leak, put it in a separate plastic bag
    - buy things duplicate, so you can have a set of stuff ready at all times (comb etc.)
    - traveling long and often? consider bringing a wetstone, smoke alarm and plunger along
    - Practice living out of your suitcase for a week before you leave; missed anything?
