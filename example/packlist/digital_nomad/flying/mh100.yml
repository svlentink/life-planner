    The Quechua MH100 35L was picked over the MH500 40L,
    because the stiff frame that makes the backpack breathable is
    a single metal rod on the 35L and a square frame on the 40L.
    The rod is easier to remove and wear under clothes
    in case an airliner would check if the backpack fits in the
    maximum allowed bag tester.
