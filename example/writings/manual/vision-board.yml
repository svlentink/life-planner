    This vision board is aimed at helping you with autobiographical planning.
    It visualizes the multiple personas/identities/roles you have (on the blue sky).
    For each persona you are able to set goals.

    As a foundation (the earth beneath) we have our strenghts, values and weaknesses.

    #### Goals
    Goals should be positive. When we say 'I cannot eat suger' (negative),
    we still identify ourself with someone who eats sugar.
    If you say
    'I am an athlete, therefore I do not eat sugar' (positive),
    it's easier to abstain from sugar.
    
    For goals we define four stages/status;
    - idea
    - progressing &#8635;
    - maintaining &#128736;
    - done
    
    Of which we visualize progressing &#8635; and maintaining &#128736; and hide idea and done from the overview.
    
    Something can start as a difficult goal and develop into a
    [passion](https://youtu.be/6MBaFL7sCb8),
    just like your first piano class was hard.

    Before creating this vision board,
    we advice some basic understanding of
    [Maslow's hierachy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) <!--
    Aristotle about happiness, first meet physical needs
    -->,
    [Sapolsky's research on dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axrywDP9Ii0),
    growth mindset,
    [Nietzsche, The Gay Science, ยง290](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/intro/gs290.html)
    and
    [Human, All Too Human](https://academyofideas.com/2017/07/psychology-of-self-deception/)

    We define roles/personas because this helps us associate ourself with the behavior needed to accomplish this (sankalpa).
