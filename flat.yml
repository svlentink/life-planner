vision board is aimed at helping you with autobiographical planning.\nIt visualizes the multiple personas/identities/roles you have (on the blue sky).\nFor each persona you are able to set goals.\n\nAs a foundation (the earth beneath) we have our strenghts, values and weaknesses.\n\n#### Goals\nGoals should be positive. When we say 'I cannot eat suger' (negative),\nwe still identify ourself with someone who eats sugar.\nIf you say\n'I am an athlete, therefore I do not eat sugar' (positive),\nit's easier to abstain from sugar.\n\nFor goals we define four stages/status;\n- idea\n- progressing &#8635;\n- maintaining &#128736;\n- done\n\nOf which we visualize progressing &#8635; and maintaining &#128736; and hide idea and done from the overview.\n\nSomething can start as a difficult goal and develop into a\n[passion](https://youtu.be/6MBaFL7sCb8),\njust like your first piano class was hard.\n<br/>\nBefore creating this vision board,\nwe advice some basic understanding of\n[Maslow's hierachy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) <!--\nAristotle about happiness, first meet physical needs\n-->,\n[Sapolsky's research on dopamine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axrywDP9Ii0),\ngrowth mindset,\n[Nietzsche, The Gay Science, §290](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/intro/gs290.html)\nand\n[Human, All Too Human](https://academyofideas.com/2017/07/psychology-of-self-deception/)\n\nWe define roles/personas because this helps us associate ourself with the behavior needed to accomplish this (sankalpa).\n\n## Why YAML\n\nYAML is the easiest configuration language out there, easier than JSON/XML/HCL (and support anchors).\nWe use a configuration language instead of a GUI because we want the user to feel like an admin of one's life.\nGUIs abstract you from what is underneath and requires less grind,\nthis tool is for dedicated users, who are committed to making a change, a change in their own lives.\nIf you need a GUI, you're not the target audience, you're not willing to put in the work needed,\nplease follow a road with less resistance, a path well paved.\n\n### Self hosted\nThis YAML and CSV based approach allows one to totally self-host their own data sources.\nGoogle sheets allows you to have sheets as CSV, with Google forms in front of it allows you to track your own
